For basemaps: You can load map data from Goong's own service. You can create and host your own map data using one of the many  open source tools . New to  @goongmaps/goong-map-react ?  Get Started Want to contribute? See our  Developer Guide Design Philosophy At Uber, we make powerful web tools that contain maps. To manage the complexity of our applications, we fully embrace React and reactive programming. The stock  goong-js  APIs are  imperative . That is, you instruct the map to do something (for example,  map.flyTo ), and it will execute the command at its own pace. This does not scale when we have many components that need to synchronize with each other. One use case we have is to render two maps side by side, and when the user interacts with one, update both cameras. We draw UI on top of the map using React, pinned to a given geolocation. We also render visualization layers on top of the map using WebGL, most notably with  deck.gl . The goong-js maps, the deck.gl canvas, and React controls' render cycles are all asynchronous. If we listen to the  move  event in the map and tell the other components to update, the other components would always be one frame behind. Ultimately, in the spirit of the  reactive programming paradigm , data always flows  down . In a complex application, any user input or data fetch can affect the rendering of many components. We might store the  source of truth  in a parent component state, or Redux store, or hooks, and let it propagate down to the map as well as its peers. As long as the map manages its own state, as goong-js is designed to do, we risk the components going out of sync. @goongmaps/goong-map-react  creates a fully reactive wrapper for  goong-js . The  InteractiveMap  component is stateless. To move the map camera in anyway, the application must update the component's props. The application can also be confident that the map's camera would never deviate from the props that it's assigned. At first glance, its API may seem verbose to those who come from the imperative world of goong-js. However, it is essential for the correctness of large applications. Limitations This library provides convenient wrappers around initializing and (to some degree) tracking the state of a Goong WebGL map. Because most of the functionality of Goong's JS API depends on the use of HTML5 canvases and WebGL, which React is not built to manipulate, the React component does not mirror all the functionality of Goong GL JS's Map class. You may access the native Goong API exposed by the  getMap()  function in this library. However, proceed with caution as calling the native APIs may break the connection between the React layer props and the underlying map state. Examples of replacing common native API calls with their React equivalents can be found on the  FAQ  page.","headings":[{"value":"Introduction","depth":1},{"value":"Design Philosophy","depth":2},{"value":"Limitations","depth":2}],"slug":"docs","title":"Introduction"},{"excerpt":"Custom Components You may create your own map control components by consuming  MapContext . Using the MapContext The following component renders a label \"(longitude, latitude)\" at the given coordinate: Using the useMapControl hook useMapControl  is an experimental API that makes it easier to create controls with event handling. Calling  useMapControl(opts)  returns an object containing the following fields: context  (MapContext) - the current context value containerRef  (RefObject) - this should be assigned to the  ref  prop of the DOM element that the event listeners should attach to. This hook supports the following options: onScroll  (Function) - called on mouse wheel event.

Instead, transitions can be defined using  InteractiveMap 's transition props. Example: Fly to a New Location See  viewport animation  for a complete example. Example: Transition Viewport To A Bounding Box You can use the  WebMercatorViewport  utility to find the target viewport that fits around a lngLat bounding box: Documentation of WebMercatorViewport Controlling Map Transitions InteractiveMap's Transition Props See properties of  InteractiveMap . transitionDuration  (Number) transitionInterpolator  (Object) transitionEasing  (Function) transitionInterruption  (Number) onTransitionStart  (Function) onTransitionInterrupt  (Function) onTransitionEnd  (Function) Transition and the onViewportChange Callback InteractiveMap  is designed to be a stateless component. For transitions to work, the application must update the viewport props returned by the  onViewportChange  callback: Remarks: The props returned by the callback may contain transition properties. For example, during panning and rotating, the callback is invoked with  transitionDuration: 0 , meaning that the map movement instantly matches the change of the pointer. When panning or zooming with keyboard, the callback is invoked with a 300ms linear transition. It is recommended that when programatically triggering a transition, always explicitly set the transition properties (interpolator, easing and duration). \"Set and forget\": the values of the following props at the start of a transition carry through the entire duration of the transition: transitionDuration transitionInterpolator transitionEasing transitionInterruption The default interaction/transition behavior can always be intercepted and overwritten in the handler for  onViewportChange . However, if a transition is in progress, the properties that are being transitioned (e.g. longitude and latitude) should not be manipulated, otherwise the change will be interpreted as an interruption of the transition. When using  FlyToInterpolator  for  transitionInterpolator ,  transitionDuration  can be set to  'auto'  where actual duration is auto calculated based on start and end viewports and is linear to the distance between them. This duration can be further customized using  speed  parameter to  FlyToInterpolator  constructor. Transition Interpolators A  TransitionInterpolator  instance must be supplied to the  transitionInterpolator  prop. It contains the following methods: arePropsEqual(currentProps, nextProps)  - called to determine if transition should be triggered when viewport props update. initiateProps(startProps, endProps)  - called before transition starts to pre-process the start and end viewport props. interpolateProps(startProps, endProps, t)  - called to get viewport props in transition.  t  is a time factor between  [0, 1] . @goongmaps/goong-map-react  offers two built-in interpolator classes: LinearInterpolator FlyToInterpolator","headings":[{"value":"Viewport Transition","depth":1},{"value":"Example: Fly to a New Location","depth":2},{"value":"Example: Transition Viewport To A Bounding Box","depth":2},{"value":"Controlling Map Transitions","depth":2},{"value":"InteractiveMap's Transition Props","depth":3},{"value":"Transition and the onViewportChange Callback","depth":3},{"value":"Transition Interpolators","depth":3}],"slug":"docs/advanced/viewport-transition","title":"Viewport Transition"},{"excerpt":"AttributionControl This is a React equivalent of Goong's  AttributionControl .

If  true , shows Goong's attribution control. disableTokenWarning  (Boolean) default:  false If the provided API access token is rejected by Goong,  StaticMap  renders a warning instead of failing silently. If you know what you are doing and want to hide this warning anyways, set this prop to  true . gl  (WebGLContext) This prop is experimental. Use an existing WebGLContext instead of creating a new one. This allows multiple libraries to render into a shared buffer. Use with caution. goongApiAccessToken  (String) Goong API access token for  GoongJS . Required when using Goong vector tiles/styles\nGoong WebGL context creation option.

Options specified here\nwill take precedence over those same options if set via props. preserveDrawingBuffer  (Boolean) default:  false Equivalent to Goong's  preserveDrawingBuffer   option . If  true , the map's canvas can be exported to a PNG using  map.getCanvas().toDataURL() . preventStyleDiffing  (Boolean) default:  false If  mapStyle  is assigned an Immutable object, when the prop changes,  StaticMap  can diff between the two values and call the appropriate Goong API such as  addLayer ,  removeLayer ,  setStyle ,  setData , etc.\nThis allows apps to update data sources and layer styles efficiently. In use cases such as animation or dynamic showing/hiding layers, style diffing prevents the map from reloading and flickering when the map style changes. There are known issues with style diffing. As stopgap, use this option to prevent style diffing. reuseMaps  (Boolean) default:  false This prop is experimental. If  true , when the map component is unmounted, instead of calling  remove  on the Goong map instance, save it for later reuse. This will avoid repeatedly creating new Goong map instances if possible. Applications that frequently mount and unmount maps may try this prop to help work around a goong-js resource leak issue that can lead to a browser crash in certain situations. transformRequest  (Function) default:  null A callback run before the Map makes a request for an external URL. The callback can be used to modify the url, set headers, or set the credentials property for cross-origin requests.\nExpected to return an object with a  url  property and optionally  headers  and  credentials  properties.  Equivalent to Goong's  transformRequest   map option . Map State mapStyle  (String | Object | Immutable.Map) default:  'https://tiles.goong.io/assets/goong_map_web.json' The Goong style. A string url or a\n GoongJS style \nobject (regular JS object or Immutable.Map). Whenever the  mapStyle  prop changes, the component will attempt to update the style of the underlying Goong map. The behavior can be further customized with the  preventStyleDiffing  prop. mapStyle  is ignored when explicitly set to  null . width  (Number | String, required) The width of the map. Can be either a number in pixels, or a valid CSS string. height  (Number | String, required) The height of the map. Can be either a number in pixels, or a valid CSS string. latitude  (Number) The latitude of the center of the map, as a top level prop. Only used if  viewState  is not supplied. longitude  (Number) The longitude of the center of the map, as a top level prop. Only used if  viewState  is not supplied. zoom  (Number) The tile zoom level of the map, as a top level prop. Only used if  viewState  is not supplied. Bounded implicitly by default  minZoom  and  maxZoom  of  GoongJS bearing  (Number) default:  0 Specify the bearing of the viewport, as a top level prop.

Altitude of the viewport camera, relative to screen height. viewState  (Object) An object containing the view state of the map specified by the following fields: latitude  (Number) - The latitude of the center of the map. longitude  (Number) - The longitude of the center of the map. zoom  (Number) - The tile zoom level of the map. Bounded implicitly by default  minZoom  and  maxZoom  of  GoongJS . bearing  (Number) - default:  0  - The bearing of the viewport. pitch  (Number) - default:  0  - The pitch of the viewport. altitude  (Number) - default:  1.5 screen heights Note: Either the  viewState , or the  latitude ,  longitude  and  zoom  properties need to be specified.

This will make the map synchronize better with other controls during prop-driven viewport changes. style  (Object) The CSS style of the map container. visible  (Boolean) default:  true Whether the map is visible. Unmounting and re-mounting a Goong instance is known to be costly. This option offers a way to hide a map using CSS style. visibilityConstraints  (Object) An object that specifies bounds for viewport props with  min* ,  max*  keys. If the viewport props are outside of these constraints, the Goong map is automatically hidden. Default:  { minZoom: 0, maxZoom: 20, minPitch: 0, maxPitch: 60 } Callbacks onLoad  (Function) default:  () => {} A callback run when the map emits a  load  event.

The export mainly offers a convenience when using server-side rendering. To use this API, consult Mapbox's  setRTLTextPlugin  documentation. Where is fitBounds? You can use the  WebMercatorViewport  utility to find the target viewport that fits around a longitude-latitude bounding box: Documentation of WebMercatorViewport I called flyTo/panTo and all controls went out of sync You cannot manipulate the map camera via  getMap()  and the native mapbox-gl API. To conform to the reactive programming paradigm, all camera changes should be driven by prop changes on the React component. Circumventing this will break the binding between React components and the underlying map instance. Instead, use the  InteractiveMap 's transition props. See  viewport transition  for examples. mapbox-gl-draw does not work with react-map-gl Unfortunately, react-map-gl implements its own interative logic and disables the native event handling of mapbox-gl. Short explanation: mapbox-gl is not designed to support React. Long explanation: When using react-map-gl, we have two asynchronous rendering loops, React and Mapbox. Mapbox's  move  events are only fired after the camera changes and there is no way to control how and when the map rerenders. If we update React states upon the  move  events, all React controls/overlays may only get updated one animation frame after the map rerender. You can find discussions  here  and  here . Because of this, any mapbox-gl control that listens to the native map events will not work. An equivelant to mapbox-gl-draw is  react-map-gl-draw . You can find an example  here .","headings":[{"value":"FAQ","depth":1},{"value":"Enable Right-to-Left Language Support","depth":2},{"value":"Where is fitBounds?","depth":2},{"value":"I called flyTo/panTo and all controls went out of sync","depth":2},{"value":"mapbox-gl-draw does not work with react-map-gl","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/get-started/faq","title":"FAQ"},{"excerpt":"Get Started Installation Using  @goongmaps/goong-map-react  requires  node >= v4  and  react >= 16.3 .

Its appearance is entirely controlled by the properties that are passed in from its parent. In this architecture, transition works the same way as interaction: the component shall notify the application of \"user intent\" by calling the  onViewportChange  callback, but ultimately the application needs to decide what to do with it. The most simple handling of this intent is to save it and pass it back to the component: User interaction and transition will not work without a valid  onViewportChange  handler. The advantage of this practice is that it ensures a single source of truth regarding the viewport state (in the example above, saved in the  state  of the container component). When you use this viewport state to direct the rendering of other components, it is guaranteed that they will always be synced with the map. You may apply additional constraints to the viewport: Or manipulate the viewport outside of the ReactMap component: Using with Redux If you're using redux, it is very easy to hook this component up to store state in the redux state tree.\nThe simplest way is to take all properties passed to the  onViewportChange  function property and add them\ndirectly into the store. This state can then be passed back to the  <ReactMapGL>  component without any transformation.","headings":[{"value":"State Management","depth":1},{"value":"Using with Redux","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/get-started/state-management","title":"State Management"}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["484347790"]}
